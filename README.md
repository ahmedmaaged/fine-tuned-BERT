# Fine-Tuning BERT for Grammar Classification using the CoLA Dataset
This repository contains code and instructions for fine-tuning BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to classify the grammatical acceptability of English sentences. The model is trained and evaluated on the Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability (CoLA) dataset.

The Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability (CoLA) dataset for single sentence classification.

It's a set of sentences labeled as grammatically correct or incorrect. The data is as follows:

Column 1: the code representing the source of the sentence.

Column 2: the acceptability judgment label (0=unacceptable, 1=acceptable).

Column 3: the acceptability judgment as originally notated by the author.

Column 4: the sentence.
